## 1. Implementation

- [ ] 1.1 Define integration helpers for DuckDB (relation construction from Arrow dataset or file list)
- [ ] 1.2 Define integration helpers for Polars (lazy scan from Arrow dataset or file list)
- [ ] 1.3 Define integration helpers for DataFusion (dataset/scan from file list and schema)
- [ ] 1.4 Ensure helpers reuse pruning-aware selection logic and do not re-scan storage
- [ ] 1.5 Add examples and tests for each integration path
